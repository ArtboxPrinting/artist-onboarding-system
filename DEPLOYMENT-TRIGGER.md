# Artist Onboarding System - DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER

## Status: FORCING REBUILD WITH UUID FIX

This file is updated to trigger automatic Vercel deployment.

**Last UUID Fix Applied:** Friday, May 30, 2025 - 7:06 PM
**Deployment Trigger:** UUID Issue Resolution - Force Rebuild #2

## Issue Fixed:
- ✅ Removed custom UUID generation that was causing database errors
- ✅ Let Supabase auto-generate proper UUIDs for artist records
- ✅ Schema cache refreshed and onboarding_completed column working

## Expected Result:
✅ API endpoint /api/submit-artist-application should now return success
✅ Proper UUID values stored in database
✅ Complete artist applications working end-to-end

## Test After Deployment:
```bash
curl -X POST https://artist-onboarding-app.vercel.app/api/submit-artist-application \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Final Test Artist", "email": "success@test.com", "phone": "555-0123", "artistic_specialty": "painting"}'
```

Expected: `{"success": true, "message": "PROJECT 100% COMPLETE!", ...}`
