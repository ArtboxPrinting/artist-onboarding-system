ðŸš€ FORCE DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - Section 6 Implementation

This commit is designed to trigger an automatic deployment on Vercel with the latest 8-section system.

**CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT UPDATE:**
- âœ… Section 6: Website Structure & Marketing - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- âœ… Complete 8-section artist onboarding system 
- âœ… Updated admin dashboard with Section 6 data
- âœ… Professional UI/UX across all sections
