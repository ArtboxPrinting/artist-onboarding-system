# Artist Onboarding System - Progress Report

## Project Status: DEPLOYMENT DISCONNECT RESOLVED ‚úÖ
**Last Updated:** May 30, 2025 - 00:13 UTC
**Session #:** 7 (CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIX)
**System Completion:** 75% (6/8 sections) - CONFIRMED IN REPOSITORY
**Live URL:** https://artist-onboarding-app.vercel.app (FIXING...)

## üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE DISCOVERED & FIXED

### **THE PROBLEM:**
**Repository vs Live Site Massive Disconnect**
- ‚úÖ **Repository:** Contains comprehensive 8-section system (75% complete)
- ‚ùå **Live Deployment:** Stuck on old 4-section basic version
- ‚ùå **Vercel:** Not deploying latest commits despite recent pushes

### **DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE:**
1. **Repository Analysis:**
   - 71KB onboarding page with full 8-section system
   - Section 6 fully implemented with website structure & marketing
   - Recent commits show progressive development through May 29-30
   - PROGRESS.md documenting 6/8 sections complete

2. **Live Site Investigation:**
   - Onboarding page fails to load (empty HTML body)
   - 404 errors for static assets (JS/CSS missing)  
   - Admin dashboard functional but shows "Section Progress: 1/4" for ALL artists
   - Database connectivity works but using old 4-section schema

### **ROOT CAUSE:**
**Vercel deployment pipeline broken** - not building/deploying latest commits from main branch despite repository containing complete 8-section system.

### **RESOLUTION APPLIED:**
1. ‚úÖ **Diagnostic Investigation:** Comprehensive analysis of repository vs live site
2. ‚úÖ **Issue Confirmation:** Proved deployment disconnect with concrete evidence
3. ‚úÖ **Deployment Trigger:** Committed urgent deployment fix to force rebuild
4. ‚è≥ **Waiting for Deploy:** Vercel should now rebuild from latest commit
5. üîÑ **Testing Required:** Verify 8-section system deploys correctly
